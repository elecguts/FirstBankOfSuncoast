The application should store a history of transactions in a SINGLE List<Transaction>.
 Your task is to design the Transaction class to support both checking and savings as

Never allow withdrawing more money than is available. That is, we cannot allow our
 checking or savings balances to go negative.
When prompting for an amount to deposit or withdraw always ensure the amount is positive.
 The value we store in the Transaction shall be positive as well. (e.g. a Transaction that is a withdraw of 25 both inputs and records a positive 25)
